INTEGRATING GOOGLE, YAHOO, TWITTER AND FACEBOOK
===============================================
This is an example Zend Framework 1.11.3 application that uses Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter for 
authentication of users.

INSTALATION
===========
The application contains everything that it needs to run, including full
Zend Framework 1.11.3 (with patched  Zend_OpenId_Consumer). The exceptions are Facebook and Twitter app keys that need to
be included in appkeys.ini. Normally, Facebook and Twitter require every application that uses their API to be 
registered with them. Once an application is registered,  a user gets app id and a secret key. When you have those keys 
you need to make an appkeys.ini file 

Zend_Auth_Adapter_OpenId uses file based storage. For this reason, the application
must be able to create, write and read APPLICATION_PATH . '/../tmp' folder.

It was reported that extension=php_openssl.dll should also be enabled in php.ini.


CREATE AN APPLICATION AT FACEBOOK
=================================
Visit https://developers.facebook.com/apps and Click Create new app
canvas url is the link of your website that you want to redirect after you are authenticated from facebook.
Note:
This canvas url will be used later to configure appkeys.ini file of your website(after you will complete your installation to your application)


CREATE AN APPLICATION AT Twitter
=================================

Visit https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new
Callback url is the link of your website that you want to redirect after you are authenticated from twitter
Note: Callback url can't be http://localhost/ or http://localhost:80. It should be weblink that is already online
(for test you can even use http://www.google.com/ or any other website.


CONFIGURE appkeys.ini file
(location at  Socialauth-with-zend-framework/application/configs/appkeys.ini file at your application)
==========================
facebook.redirecturi = [Canvas URL] 
facebook.appid = [App ID/API Key]
facebook.secret = [App Secret]
Note: Canvas URL, APpp ID/API Key and App Secret are taken from your facebook application

twitter.appid = [Consumer key]
twitter.secret = [Consumer secret]
twitter.redirecturi = Callback URL
Note: Consumer key, Consumer secret and Callback URL are taken from your twitter application
